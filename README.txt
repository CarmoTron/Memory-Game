Memoria_Jogo_Bruno.py --> the original

This game was developed by me while I was attending school to pursue a degree
in Computer Programming. We were tasked with creating a game in Python. 
I decided to try the classic memory game.
In this game, I managed to overcome the difficulties I encountered, 
but I still need to fix some bugs related to when I flip cards that are not identical, 
as they shrink significantly. 
This only happens when I use images as the faces of the cards.
